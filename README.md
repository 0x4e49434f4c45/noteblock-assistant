# Note Block Assistant

Note Block Assistant is a utility mod for making note block songs. It's designed to automate the manual steps in the way
I personally make note block songs, particularly the compaction step. If you also find it helpful, wonderful!

Note Block Assistant provides three commands:
- `/nba generate` generates a template with the specified parameters for length and meter, as well as instrument blocks
  (the blocks that go underneath the note blocks).
- `/nba select` loads the completed song and validates it, preparing it for compaction.
- `/nba placeCompact` places a compacted version of the song into the world. You can specify the length of the compacted
  version, or let the command choose a length that gets the result as close to square as possible for optimal listening.
